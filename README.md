|Oil and filter change|Your engine oil needs to be changed regularly to ensure engine longevity.|
|Air filter|Bikes are fitted with either a paper or foam type air filter element. |
|Spark Plugs|Over time, spark plugs will show signs of wear and the gap between their electrodes will go out of adjustment.|
|Drive chain adjustment|There should be a certain amount of slack in the drive chain |
|Oiling cables, levers and pivots|Because cables, stand and lever pivots are exposed to the elements, they must be lubed regularly to ensure smooth operation.|
|Clutch adjustment|Correct adjustment of the clutch is important to ensure smooth gear changes and prevent clutch slip or drag. |
|Engine idle speed (tick over speed)|Check that the engine idles at the correct speed when it is fully warmed up. There is usually an idle speed adjuster knob at the side of the carburettors.|
|Brake pads|Your brake pad friction material will eventually wear down to a low level, at which point the pads must be renewed. |
