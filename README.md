***<h1 > Things I Assured to be done</h1>***

|What?| Why?|
|------|------|
|[Oil and filter change](https://www.amazon.in/Royal-Enfield-Himalayan-411cc-Filter/dp/B082QY5D4D)|Your engine oil needs to be changed regularly to ensure engine longevity.|
|[Air filter](https://www.amazon.in/BMC-Air-Filter-Enfield-Himalayan/dp/B077ZHTTQH)|Bikes are fitted with either a paper or foam type air filter element. Which gets dusty with time and need to be replaced. |

So it is important to Clean the Spark Plugs with each Service.|
|Drive chain adjustment|There should be a certain amount of slack in the drive chain to get full tourque , So it is always important to see chain adjustment.|
|Oiling cables, levers and pivots|Because cables, stand and lever pivots are exposed to the elements, they must be lubed regularly to ensure smooth operation.|
|Clutch adjustment|Correct adjustment of the clutch is important to ensure smooth gear changes and prevent clutch slip or drag so always insure the changes to made with clutching system.  |
|Engine idle speed (tick over speed)|Check that the engine idles at the correct speed when it is fully warmed up. There is usually an idle speed a be done with clutchadjuster knob at the side of the carburettors.|
